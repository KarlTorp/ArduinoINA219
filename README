* TI INA219 hi-side i2c current/power monitor Library for Arduino

*
*
* Tested at standard i2c 100kbps signaling rate.
*
* This library does not handle triggered conversion modes. It uses the INA219
* in continuous conversion mode. All reads are from continous conversions.
*
* A note about the gain setting:
*	The gain of the ADC amplifier is programmable in the INA219, and can
*	be set between 1/8x (default) and unity. This allows a shunt voltage 
*	range of +/-320mV to +/-40mV respectively. Something to keep in mind,
*	however, is that this change in gain DOES NOT affect the resolution
*	of the ADC, which is fixed at 1uV. As such, changing the gain will
*	not mask noise or result in a more accurate reading, so it is 
*	recommended that you use the default setting (3) for the widest range
*	of shunt voltage values.
*
*
* Known bugs:
*     * may return unreliable values if not connected to a bus or at
*	bus currents below 1uA.
*
* Dependencies:
*    * Arduino Wire library
